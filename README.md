# WebMUSA
a Web-based Multi User Space Adventure (MUD)

## The goal of WebMUSA is both to bring the concept of the MUD into the modern age,
as well as provide a home for the [/QBFreak/WebMUSA/SolarWindsMARE](Solar Winds) project.

The project consists of a browser-based front-end using WebSockets, and back-end Python WebSockt server/MUD engine.
