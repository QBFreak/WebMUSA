# WebMUSA
a Web-based Multi User Space Adventure (MUD)

## Goals
The goal of WebMUSA is both to bring the concept of the MUD into the modern age,
as well as provide a home for the [Solar Winds](/QBFreak/SolarWindsMARE) project.

## Layout
The project consists of a browser-based front-end using WebSockets, and back-end Python WebSockt server/MUD engine.
